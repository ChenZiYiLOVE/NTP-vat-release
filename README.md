# NTP Vat

![bullet](docs/bullet_screenshot.png)

This repo is adapted from [Kuan Fang](https://github.com/kuanfang/)'s PyBullet wrapper (VAT).

### Requirements:
1. Python 2.7

2. Note that this repo only works with PyBullet 1.2.9. I'm working on a fix to make it work with the newest PyBullet release (1.8)
- Install `Bullet 3.x.` by `pip install pybullet==1.2.9` or simply `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage:

Demo: run `python demo.py --time_step 0.001` to execute expert policy of the Block Stacking task.
